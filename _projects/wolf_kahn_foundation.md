The Wolf Kahn Foundation is dedicated to preserving, promoting, and sharing the artistic achievements of Vermont painter Wolf Kahn. Our design for their new site put his art front-and-center and incorporated design elements that call back to his specific aesthetic style, all wrapped in a speedy, modern Wordpress build.
