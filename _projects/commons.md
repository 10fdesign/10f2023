The Commons is a newspaper that gives voice to Southern Vermont's residents, with an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion. We built them a custom Ruby on Rails app that uses a proprietary API connection to automatically publish each week's stories to the website, and manages their archives of over 10,000 articles. We also implemented a custom search algorithm, a new advertising platform, and many other smaller touches to connect the Commons to their audience.
