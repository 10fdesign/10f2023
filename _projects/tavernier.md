Tavernier Chocolates is a Brattleboro chocolatier making earthy, elegant, seasonally-inspired artisanal chocolates handcrafted in the splendor of southern Vermont. We designed and built their site from scratch, and have refreshed it many times over the years. It highlights the craft and beauty of its chocolates, and boasts a suite of ecommerce features and advanced analytics under the hood.
