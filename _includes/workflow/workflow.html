    sit
    down and discuss your business to identify the goals and requirements for your Wordpress site. Through this process,
    we'll be able to identify and solve problems from the ground up so that we can create your website as efficiently as

    give
    your feedback to ensure that we're matching your vision. Then, we'll create a series of mockups for key pages on the
    website as well as for mobile devices."

    create
    a fully functional, mobile-responsive version of your website for you to test and review with your team. And after a
    few rounds of feedback and revisions, 10F will launch your website, and you'll be able to share it with the world."
